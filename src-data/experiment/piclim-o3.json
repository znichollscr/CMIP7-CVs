Required model settings We encourage modelling centres to include as much atmospheric composition capability as possible. But, as a minimum, models should have tropospheric chemistry and interactive aerosols. And the experimental setup should be consistent with other AerChemMIP2 experiments, particularly piClim-control. For methane, use year-1850 values in the radiation scheme (2021 values in the chemistry scheme).  3. Experiment conditions  4. Links to relevant references Fiedler et al. (in prep.)
