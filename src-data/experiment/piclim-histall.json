    "description": "A simulation with *all* time-varying forcings (*both natural and anthropogenic*) following the historical and ScenarioMIP `scen7-mc` scenario. Greenhouse gases should be prescribed concentrations. Simulations are run atmosphere-only, with a 12-month repeating climatology of sea surface temperatures and sea-ice distributions taken from a climatology of at least 30 years of the same model's `piControl` run. Interactive vegetation, if present in the model, should be turned on. Experiment design is similar to CMIP6 `piClim-histall` experiment (Pincus et al. 2016) with the future scenario changed from `ssp245` to `scen7-mc`.  Pincus, R., Forster, P.
