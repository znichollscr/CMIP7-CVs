Required model settings We encourage modelling centres to include as much atmospheric composition capability as possible. As a minimum, models should have prescribed or interactive aerosols. And the experimental setup should be consistent with other AerChemMIP2 experiments, particularly piClim-control.  3. Experiment conditions  4. Links to relevant references Fiedler et al. (in prep.)
