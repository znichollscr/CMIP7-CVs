    "description": "1. Detailed experiment configuration An atmosphere only configuration following piClim-control but with emissions of all fire-derived gases and aerosols scaled by a factor of 2. Setup consistent with the fire parameterization in piClim-control experiments (e.g., NOx, BC, OC, CO, VOCs, CH4, DMS, SO2 or a subset of these for CHEM)  2. Required model settings We encourage modelling centres to include as much atmospheric composition capability as possible. As a minimum, models should have prescribed or interactive aerosols. And the experimental setup should be consistent with other AerChemMIP2 experiments, particularly piClim-control.   3. Experiment conditions  4. Links to relevant references Fiedler et al. (in prep.)
