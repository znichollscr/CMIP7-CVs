    "description": "1. Detailed experiment configuration An atmosphere only configuration following piClim-control but using present-day (2021) aerosol and non-methane tropospheric ozone precursors  2. Required model settings We encourage modelling centres to include as much atmospheric composition capability as possible. But, as a minimum, models should have tropospheric chemistry and interactive aerosols. And the experimental setup should be consistent with other AerChemMIP2 experiments, particularly piClim-control.  3. Experiment conditions  4. Links to relevant references Fiedler et al. (in prep.) AerChemMIP2 - Unraveling the role of reactive gases, aerosols, and land use for air quality and climate change in CMIP7  5. Similarities to CMIP6 experiments: piClim-NTCF  6.
