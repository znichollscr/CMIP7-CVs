This includes changes in suphur dioxide, black carbon, organic carbon, ammonia, NOx and VOCs, from biomass burning, industrial emissions, and other sources.  Other forcings held at piControl levels. 2. Coupled simulations initialized from the piControl and run to 2021 under historical aerosol emissions and thereafter to 2035 using the medium scenario with other forcings held fixed at piControl levels. 3.
